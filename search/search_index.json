Limited ranching took hold, herding Gehi and Marra. A mass exodus resulting from flooding in the Liar\u00e9 Basin led to the introduction of agriculture, leading to the decline of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle in Tagori. Most Tagori Liyuno transitioned to farming through spring and fall, staying in permanent settlements centered around regions safe from the harshest times of year.

This prevented agriculture from reaching the north, and in antiquity the people of each region did not even know that the other side of the river was populated.

The frigid conditions of Irina are fairly inhospitable, and only the most resilient of plants can tolerate its harsh nights.</p> <p>Meats are thus very prominent in Liyuno cuisine; venison, mutton, and other game are found in most dishes dating back to ancient times. Barley and, later, rice were introduced by traders, and serve as the basis for Liyuno staple foods. Rice is farmed on the banks of the plateau's many rivers, which flood over the summers. Barley is primarily farmed in Tazima, and is farmed in such quantities that it is cheaper than rice.</p> <p>Farming on the Plateau is typically conducted with the aid of Gehi and marrai. While gehi are employed much as one might expect\u2014i.e., hauling ploughs and other equipment\u2014marrai are employed for clearing snow from the fields, as the brief windows of summer heat across Avrasol render most crops unable to survive after spring.</p> <p>Supplies of rice are stretched by mixing in barley; bowls of such mixtures are served with meals.

There are two varieties of livestock raised: marrai and Gehi.</p> <p>Miama harvested from both animals is used to produce most traditional clothing in the region. Since white enables better camouflage for hunters in the winter months, white clothing is seen as fashionable, and miama from gehi is often bleached with lye throughout the summer. Marrai are less docile than gehi, making them more difficult to raise, but their miama is significantly softer, lighter, and already snow-white. This makes miama marrai much more expensive and fashionable than miama gehi. Aristocrats and the wealthy wear clothes exclusively fashioned from miama marrai, the middle class typically has a couple outfits made of miama gehi for work and miama marrai for events. The lower classes cannot afford miama marrai, and typically wear only undyed miama gehi.</p> <p>Miama marrai is, additionally, more receptive to dying than miama gehi. Textiles made from it are one of several prized exports from Aivahje. While white was initially valued for its camouflaging properties, the extreme impracticality of wearing lavishly colored clothing came to make bright colors equally fashionable in Rausean high society. Dyes and colored fabrics are a favorite import, especially from the temperate territories of Moram\u00e9, where brightly colored clothes are commonplace. In Aivahje it is thus easy judge wealth from the colorfulness of their dress.</p> <p>Irina is one of the coldest regions in Avrasol. Even in the summer, the hottest days only reach 24\u00b0C. Clothes are thus typically made from the warmest available materials, and are layered heavily. For the average middle-class Rausean, daily garb consists of a large miama gehi cloak (a luma) over a waist-length jacket. Aslai (s.g. aslo) are a particular variety of traditional luma, typically worn throughout the winter and during festivals and derived from camoflauging cloaks worn by hunters. Aslai are both fashionable and functional, usually being patterned brightly (losing the original circumstances of the garment's creation) and insulated warmly with inwards-facing miama marrai. The resulting cloak is both warm and waterproof, and serves as a fashionable way to keep oneself safe from the weather.</p>"},{"location":"Avrasol/Irina/Liyuno/#family-organization","title":"Family Organization","text":"<p>Cambre'a families are organized into large, extended families called loma and smaller, atomic, immediate families called racai. Each racai has a family head known as the racadian, and the loma is led by the oldest racadian of the loma, named the racadianta.</p> <p>The spouse of the racadian is called the azagi. When a couple wishes to get married, they approach the racadianta of their respective loma, who must then meet and negotiate the terms of the marriage. At this meeting, they must agree which of the two will be denoted the racadian and which will be denoted the azagi. The azagi is expected to remain at home, raise children, and manage the household.</p> <p>Family lineage is highly revered, and every member of a loma is expected to obey first their racadiana, followed by the directions of their own racadian, and finally each other racadian in the loma, with the least heed given to the youngest.</p> <p>Marriages are very formalized affairs. The prospective couple begins by informing their racadianta, who will meet and negotiate who will be the racadian and who will be the azagi. The couple has no say in this discussion. If there is a disagreement that the racadianta cannot resolve themselves, sometimes an outside arbiter (often a racadianta of a third loma) is brought in to help negotiate. If an agreement still cannot be come upon, then the marriage is not sanctioned.</p> <p>Once a racadian for the new couple has been agreed upon, the family of the racadian assembles a dower[^dower] for the azagi's racai in return for removing that person from their family line. The families of the bethrotheds then prepare for a marriage ceremony.</p> <p>[^dower]: While the term dower is not strictly accurate and the term bride price more accurately descripbes the price, the overt gendering of the latter makes it unappealing, especially as the gender of the \"bride\" is irrelevant: the price must be paid, regardless of gender.</p> <p>After marriage, the azagi is no longer considered a part of their former loma, and instead takes on the racadian's loma as their own.</p> <p>Traditionally, Liyuno families are monogamous, but it is not unheard of in ancient times for a marrying racadian to take multiple azagi. This practice is, however, effectively exclusive to affluent, upper class individuals. As time has progressed into the modern age, this practice has been largely replaced with the taking of gavsarau. Gavsarau are in practice largely similar to concubines, being considered partners of the racadian and subserviant to the azagi, who masters the house. It is socially acceptable for a racadian to take as many gavsarau as they can afford. Since every racai is expected to bear at least one child to maintain the loma, and taking gavsarau is seen as a reasonable means of producing children especially if the racadian and azagi are incapable of bearing children together. Note that children born in this manner (called kihsau) are considered to be less valuable and more distanced from the family line than their direct-born counterparts (called kiku). When deciding inheritance, kiku are often given precedence over kihsau, and kihsau are often bullied and disparaged by their \"pure-blooded\" relatives.</p> <p>The process for obtaining a gavsarau is notably less formal. The racadian who wishes to obtain one need only to request the potential concubine from their family's racadian. If the person in question is not the family's kita (see below) the family will often agree and and place a dower[^dower] on the union. Again, the requested individual has no say in the process, although in many cases racadian are known to respect their wishes and refuse to marry them off to someone they do not care for or in some cases even abhor.</p> <p>Most families do not have gavsarau, and typically have at least two to four children. In most households, the oldest child (called the kita) is expected to lead their siblings and serve as a role model. It is the kita who is expected to continue the family's loma, and thus most families will argue fiercely for their eldests to be racadian and not azagi. If a younger child is married first as a racadian, then this pressure on the eldest is reduced, although social custom still dictates that they should marry as racadian. Eldest siblings who become azagi are frowned upon privately but not openly mocked.</p> <p>Kita are expected to bear children within a few years of marriage. While same-sex marriage is actively expected in most situations, for kita it is only socially acceptable if their new family's racadian is wealthy enough to afford an opposite-sex gavsarau, in which case they are expected to obtain one as soon as possible following marriage.</p> <p>Adoption is not considered a means of extending the family loma and is instead viewed as a form of charitable work. Adopted children are not allowed the use of the family name, which is regulated by the racadianta. If they do not have a known family name of their own, they are given a new one by their adoptive parent or parents.</p> <p>Should the kita die before marriage and bearing children, the title falls to the next-oldest sibling, as well as all of the responsibilities and expectations.</p>"},{"location":"Avrasol/Irina/Liyuno/#religon","title":"Religon","text":""},{"location":"Avrasol/Irina/Liyuno/#language","title":"Language","text":"<p>The Liyuno speak [[Lajaque\u2019]] (Lajanqua Kisrilis), which has two major dialects divided across the river: Lajan Tazinqua, of the north bank Tazima; and Lajan Tagoriqua, of the south bank Tagori.</p>"},{"location":"Avrasol/Irina/Moramean%20Ridge/","title":"Moramean Ridge","text":"<p>The Moramean Ridge is a small plateau west of the Forest of Hidden Treasures.</p>"},{"location":"Avrasol/Irina/Arisirimo%20Ralaros/Arisirimo%20Ralaros%E2%80%99/","title":"Arisirimo Ralaros\u2019","text":"<p>Arisirimo Ralaros\u2019, the Lake of Lanterns, is a large lake north of Irina.

Because miama marrai is only of average strength, it is often used as a liner for more durable garments. Marrai are also frequently used to clear large patches of snow for construction in the winter.

Following the belated invention of the [[steam engine]], the [[train]] became the most common means of overland transportation.</p> <p>Of course, airships have also been turned to military applications.

Typically, troopships have a relatively low armament in order to keep the overall mass low and increase troop capacity; thus, they are usually held back at the beginning of an engagement. Troopships are critical to invasion forces, especially on intercontinental raids, and any army equipped with troopships is far more likely to win victory than one without.</p> <p>Arguably more important than the troopship, however, is the battleship. Battleships are loaded with [[artillery|auremic artillery batteries]] installed on dedicated numerous dedicated gun decks. Because of the overall shape of the craft, most guns are on the port and starboard sides, enabling powerful broadsides. Most batteries are also articulated, enabling some vertical flexibility in aiming these attacks.
